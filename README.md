# MyMoviesAnalytics
Your watched movies in, graphs about them out! :clapper:

### What is it? :thought_balloon:
It is a little project I developed to reinforce my knowledge in CSS, Javascript and jQuery.

You insert the name of the movies you've watched and it'll return you a chart, indicating from where the movies come from.

You can also export the list of movies to an XML, saving your progress. And, as expected, you can import it back to the project to continue it!

There's also a button to see some credits :simple_smile:

### How to use it? :arrow_forward:

To use the software, you have to download the archives and open the page **chart.html** in the browser of your preference (I have only tested it in Google Chrome, so I cannot guarantee a perfect functioning in any other browser).

### Things I would like to do in this project :+1:

- [X] Show the amount of time the person spend watching the movies from the list
  - [ ] Make it look more user friendly (showing in hours, days, months, etc)
- [X] Show a counter with the quantity of movies watched
- [ ] Find a way to show from where each movie comes from
- [ ] Add new graphics (Any idea? Please contact me!)
  - [ ] In case of new graphics, add checkbox to let the user choose which graphs he would like to see
  
### Plugins and APIs that I used in this project :computer:

:bar_chart: For generating the charts, I used [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

:movie_camera: For getting the information from the movies, I used [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
  
### Credits :raising_hand:

Hi there! My name is Olivia. CSS, Javascript and jQuery are technologies that I really like and I'm not using in my current work. (I'm not a big fan of front-end development tho. And I also do not have a sharp aesthetic sense.)

Feel free to email me any questions, tips or feedbacks about this little project. I'll be happy to reply! My email is oli.pmatt@gmail.com.
